-- Release Notes --

Release 0.7.1.2, 21 March 2012

* The Modify action now supports replacing a header based on a regex in the value field.
  Any string in the value for a Modify action which matches the form /foo/bar/ triggers the code.
  foo can be a regular expression and bar is the string which replaces the match.
  Example: 
    Action: Modify
    Name: Host
    Value: /^w{0,3}\.?domain.com$/192.168.254.65/
    This will change www.domain.com and domain.com to 192.168.254.65 if found in the Host header.
    Warning: This wouldn't work for matching '/' (such as in http://)
